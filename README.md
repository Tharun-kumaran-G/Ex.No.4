## AI-Powered Prompting Experiment: Self-Driving Cars at Crowded Intersections

## Scenario
How can self-driving cars prioritize safety when navigating crowded intersections?

Self-driving cars face complex decision-making challenges in crowded intersections where pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles move unpredictably.
The aim of this experiment is to apply different AI prompting techniques to analyze strategies, compare alternatives, and evaluate the effectiveness of safety-first navigation.

## 1. Comparative Analysis Prompt

### Prompt Example
Compare how self-driving cars can prioritize safety at crowded intersections using three different approaches:

* Sensor fusion with LiDAR + cameras
* Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication
* AI-based risk prediction models. Highlight strengths, weaknesses, and best use cases.

### AI Response (Expected)

* Sensor fusion (LiDAR + cameras): Offers highly accurate object recognition, though performance drops in adverse weather and costs are high.
* V2X communication: Improves coordination and extends awareness beyond direct visibility, but relies on supporting infrastructure and widespread adoption.
* AI-based risk prediction: Identifies potential risky actions by learning behavioral patterns, yet demands extensive datasets and can lack interpretability.

### Comparative Insight:

* Sensor fusion → provides instant situational detection.
* V2X → enables better traffic coordination and shared knowledge.
* AI prediction → introduces predictive foresight into human behavior.
Best solution: Integrating all three creates the most reliable safety system at busy intersections.

## 2. Comparative Analysis Prompt (Alternative Framing)

### Prompt Example

Evaluate how safety prioritization differs when self-driving cars adopt a conservative decision-making model versus an assertive decision-making model at intersections. Which approach minimizes accidents and which ensures smoother traffic flow?

### AI Response (Expected)

* Conservative model: Reduces accident risk but slows traffic.
* Assertive model: Improves flow but raises accident likelihood.

### Comparative Insight

* Conservative → prioritizes safety.
* Assertive → prioritizes efficiency.
Best solution: A balanced mix based on intersection conditions.

## 3. Prompt Size Limitations Technique

### Short Prompt

Prompt: "How should self-driving cars ensure safety at busy intersections?"
AI Response: Use sensors, predict movements, obey traffic laws, prioritize pedestrians.

### Extended Prompt

Prompt: "Explain the methods self-driving cars can use to maximize safety at crowded intersections, including how they rely on sensors, predict the movements of nearby vehicles and pedestrians, follow traffic regulations, and prioritize the protection of vulnerable road users like pedestrians."
AI Response: Multi-layered strategies → advanced perception, V2X integration, ethical decision frameworks, redundancies.

Observation:
* Short prompts = General, surface-level responses
* Extended prompts = Rich, structured insights

## 4. Experimental Setup

* Objective: Examine how various prompting styles influence AI in suggesting strong safety strategies.
* Method: Apply comparative analysis prompts, adjust their framing, and compare brief versus expanded versions.
* Data: Insights from autonomous driving safety research combined with AI-generated outputs.
* Evaluation Metric: Measured by how detailed, clear, and practical the responses are.

## 5. Results and Analysis

* Comparative prompts → Highlight advantages and limitations of safety approaches.
* Alternative framing → Exposes the balance between safety and efficiency.
* Prompt size variations → Demonstrate that detailed prompts yield more tailored, scenario-focused strategies.
